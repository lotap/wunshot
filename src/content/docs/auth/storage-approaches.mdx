title: Storage Approaches

## Understanding the options

A session is a collection of user data that persists across uses of your application.

**wunshot provides two main approaches for storing session data: cookies and your database.**

:::note[Browser `sessionStorage` API]
The HTML5 [`sessionStorage` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) is not a good fit for storing session data for most apps. The data stored there is erased when the tab is closed.

The browser also has the ability to write to `sessionStorage` directly, so information stored there should not be trusted.

### Cookie(s)

Cookie storage keeps the data on an [`HttpOnly` cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#httponly).

You can think of this sort of like your application issuing driver's licenses to your users:

1. Your app gives a "license" (the cookie) to a user.
2. When the user returns, they present the license back.

The problem is that the "bouncer" (your app) is blind. It scans the license to test if it's legitimate and then implicitly trusts all the information on it.

That means:

- If a bad actor steals or copies the license, they can impersonate the user.
- If the user is abusive, there's not a simple way to revoke the license.

Cookies also have some other limitations to be aware of:

- Cookies are limited to about 4KB of data.
  - This can be mitigated in a variety of methods, but each of them has their own tradeoffs.
- Since the data is stored on the client, it can eventually be decrypted. **Cookies are not a good place to store sensitive information.**

:::note[JWT/JWE]

Many apps choose to format the cookie data as a [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction) or JWE (JWT with encrypted content). This is a standardized format for the shape of data. It is useful if your app needs to interact with other apps that use JWT. However, **not all cookie sessions need to be JWTs or JWEs.**

### Database

Storing the session in a database also relies on [`HttpOnly` cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#httponly). But in this case, the cookie only contains an id for the session. The actual session data is stored in a database row.

You can think of it like your app issuing Social Security Numbers:

1. Your app gives the SSN to a user.
2. When the user returns, they present the SSN back.
3. Your app looks up the information associated with the SSN. It's like your app's version of a credit check.

This approach offers some advantages:

- Your app can reject users based on the information retrieved
- Information can be stored in the database without worrying about the space limitations of cookies

But there are also some tradeoffs to be aware of:

- Retrieving information from the database can be expensive in time and bandwidth.

  - Without thoughtful design, a bad actor could use those lookups as an attack vector - either for (D)DOS or to drive up the costs of running the app.

- Identity theft remains a risk. If a bad actor steals or copies the session id, they can impersonate that user until the session is invalidated in the database.

:::note[Key-Value Storage]
For all intents and purposes, key-value storage has the same security tradeoffs as a database.

The main difference between using a database and a key-value store is that a database must be structured ahead of time. A key-value store is more flexible, and can be structured on the fly.

Depending on your setup, a KV solution may be more efficient than a database. However, it may also add complexity when it comes to defining a single source of truth for user data if you already have a database.

### Hybrid

- A cookie is used for unauthenticated users.
  - The cookie stores an `authenticated` boolean flag.
- Database is used post-authentication.
- Information may be stored in the cookie post-authentication if it:

  1. Doesn't need to be secure
  2. Doesn't need to be synchronized across devices
