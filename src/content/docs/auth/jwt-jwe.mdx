JWT and JWE are two of the most commonly used authentication methods. They are both secure and easy to use, but they have some differences.

JWT is a simple, stateless token that is signed with a secret. It is easy to use, but it is not as secure as JWE.

JWE is a more secure method that uses a public/private key pair. It is more complex to use, but it is more secure than JWT.

Both JWT and JWE are used in wunshot, but JWE is the default.

[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) (JWT) are a simple, stateless token that is signed with a secret. They are easy to use, but they are not as secure as JWE.

### Pros

- Easy to use
- Simple to implement

### Cons

- Not as secure as JWE

## JWE

[JSON Web Encryption](https://jwt.io/) (JWE) is a more secure method that uses a public/private key pair. It is more complex to use, but it is more secure than JWT.

### Pros

- More secure than JWT
- More complex to implement

### Cons

- More complex to use
