title: Username & Password
---

:::caution
A password based authentication requires a database (to store the passwords). If you want to only use cookies for auth, then a different approach is required.
:::

:::danger
Username authentication has no implicit way to send a forgotten password. **If a user forgets their username or password, their account may be unrecoverable.**

Consider requiring an email or using an email-based approach instead.

## Schema

```ts title="@/db/schema.ts" {3} ins={13-14}
import "server-only"; // <- if you are using react server components

import { pgTable, timestamp, uuid, varchar } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { precision: 3, withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at", { precision: 3, withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
  username: varchar("username", { length: 16 }).notNull().unique(),
  passwordHash: varchar("password_hash", { length: 97 }).notNull(),
});
```

  <summary>Why use a `varchar(n)` instead of `text`?</summary>

    In PostgreSQL, `varchar` allows you to specify a [maximum length for the column without using blank character padding](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-character.html#DATATYPE-CHARACTER).

    Without setting a limit, the size of the input could be as large as the column allows. The maximum size for a single field in PostgreSQL is [1 GB](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/limits.html#LIMITS-TABLE). That could be exploited by a bad actor to use extra space and processing in your database.

    :::caution
    Restricting the length is only a partial solution to sanitizing user input. Doing so on the database columns is a last line of defense.

    Input sanitization and validation should be done on the server before ever reaching the database.
    :::

    :::note
    `text` columns are more performant than `varchar(n)` columns because they don't include the length check

    In a future version of wunshot, `text` with a `CHECK` constraint may be the recommended approach. That would enable a more comprehensive check for accepted characters and length without the overhead of the `varchar(n)` check.

    At time of writing, [Drizzle ORM does not support `CHECK` constraints](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/indexes-constraints#check).

  <summary>Why use `{ length: 16 }` for `username`?</summary>

    Specifying the actual number to use for the limit comes down to personal preference and UI constraints. I chose 16 somewhat arbitrarily. For comparison, [Twitter/X uses 15](https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/x-username-rules), TikTok uses 24, and Instagram uses 30.

    If you are building a system where actual names are used for the username (ex: `[firstname]_[lastname]`), then a longer limit may be appropriate.

<details>
  <summary>Why use `{ length: 97 }` for `password_hash`?</summary>
    For this recommendation, I assume that passwords will be run through [argon2id with recommended settings](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#argon2id) before being sent to the database. The total output should be 97 characters long if the hash length is set to 32 bytes (the digest will be 43 characters).

    **Ideally, you should use the exact length of the output of whatever hashing algorithm you are using.** But if you aren't sure, `text` is an adequate choice.

    <details>
      <summary>Why not use `pgcrypto crypt()`?</summary>
        `pgcrypto` provides a built-in [`crypt()` function that hashes passwords](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgcrypto.html#PGCRYPTO-PASSWORD-HASHING-FUNCS).
        There are four main reasons wunshot opts not to use it:
        1. Relying on a database function for hashing means that the password would need to remain in plaintext while in transit. (All transit between your app and the database should be encrypted, but that's a different topic.)
        2. The recommended `argon2id` algorithm is not available in `pgcrypto`.
        3. `pgcrypto` integration with Drizzle ORM is not straight-forward. It would involve a lot of magic `sql`
        4. Hashing in the server/application layer continues to _just work_ if a different RDBMS is used.

## Queries

```ts title="@/db/users/queries.ts" ins={4-5}
const preparedInsertUser = db
  .insert(users)
  .values({
    username: sq.placeholder("username"),
    passwordHash: sq.placeholder("passwordHash"),
  })
  .prepare("insert_user");
```

## Operations

### Create user

```ts title="@/ops/create-user.ts"
import { hash } from "@node-rs/argon2";
import * as v from "valibot";

import { insertUser } from "@/db/users/queries";

const usernameSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string(),
  v.minLength(4),
  v.maxLength(16),
  v.regex(
    /^[a-z0-9_]+$/,
    "can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, or underscores",
  ),
  v.regex(/^[a-z0-9].*$/, "must start with a letter"),
  v.regex(/^.+[a-z0-9]$/, "must end with a letter"),
  v.regex(/^((?!__).)*$/, "cannot contain consecutive underscores"),
  v.regex(/^((?!admin).)*$/i, "cannot contain the word 'admin'"),
);

const passwordSchema = v.pipe(
  v.string(),
  v.minLength(8),
  v.normalize("NFKC"),
  v.maxBytes(72),
);

export const userInputSchema = v.object({
  username: usernameSchema,
  password: passwordSchema,
});

export const hashOptions = {
  memoryCost: 19456,
  timeCost: 2,
  outputLen: 32,
  parallelism: 1,
};

export default async function createUser(input: unknown) {
  try {
    const { username, password } = v.parse(userInputSchema, input);
    const passwordHash = await hash(password, hashOptions);
    await insertUser({ username, passwordHash });
  } catch (error) {
    // TODO: use actual logging & error reporting
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

<summary>What's going on with the password requirements</summary>

Based on information from [OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#implement-proper-password-strength-controls) and [NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecret), the only hard restriction on password input should be a minimum length of 8 characters.

The `normalize` function is used to ensure unicode support. Read more about unicode normalization [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Normal_forms) and [here](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/).

The 72 `maxBytes` limit is **not** exactly in line with the OWASP and NIST recommendations, but I think it will work well for most applications.

- [72 bytes is the maximum input size the BCRYPT hashing algorithm can handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#User_input)
- It is _probably_ large enough for a 64 character passphrase (if it's UTF-8 encoded)
- It prevents [DoS attacks associated with long passwords](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/long-password-denial-of-service/)

If you are using a different hashing algorithm, you can use something like `v.maxLength(64)` or higher instead.
