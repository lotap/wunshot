## A Typescript App

You can set up a typescript project with any major framework.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/typescript)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/vite#typescript-integration)
- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest)
- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/typescript)
- [SolidStart](https://docs.solidjs.com/configuration/typescript)

You are not limited to frontend frameworks or frameworks at all. [See how to run typescript with Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/introduction)

:::note
You can also use plain ol' javascript if you prefer, but the provided code will be written for typescript.

## A database (PostgreSQL)

You must have access to a database. If you don't, you can start with the [PostgreSQL Download Page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or [Detailed installation guides](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) or see [How to Use the Postgres Docker Official Image](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-use-the-postgres-docker-official-image/). Another good option for local development that can manage multiple versions/instances of PostgreSQL without the overhead of docker is [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/).

There are numerous hosting/cloud options for PostgreSQL beyond the scope of this guide.

Once your database is set up, you should have connection URL that looks something like:

```txt "USER" "PASSWORD" "HOST" "PORT" "DATABASE_NAME" "PARAM_NAME" "PARAM_VALUE"
postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME?PARAM_NAME=PARAM_VALUE
```

[Read more about connection URIs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS)

Add your connection URL to your project's `.env` file or secrets manager.

:::note
Other RDBMS options can be used, but are not officially supported. You will need to handle the translation of the schemas into your database of choice.

### (Optional) Set postgres timezone to UTC

Setting the database timezone to UTC probably won't cause any headaches, but might save you from a few down the road.

```txt title="postgresql.conf"
timezone = 'UTC'
```

If you don't have access to `postgresql.conf`, you can try setting it like this:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE your_db_name SET timezone TO 'UTC';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

:::note
`GMT` is effectively the same as `UTC`
:::

:::tip
You can get the current timezone of your database by running:

```sql
SHOW timezone;
```

## (Optional) `server-only`

If you are using react server components, you should use the [server-only](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) package. This will prevent the client from being able to import the module.

```sh
npm i server-only
```

:::tip
You may also want to use the `experimental_taintUniqueValue` function to prevent leaking secrets.
